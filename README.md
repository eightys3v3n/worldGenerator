# world_generator
experimentation with 2D world generation using multi-threading in C++.

This project was started when I was still learning C++, way back in grade 11 or 12. The purpose was to generate a 2D tile based world around the player.
It then evolved into generating that world using multi-threading in a particular pattern around the player.
